# Caesar Cipher
It's based on pure JavaScript, without jQuery or something.

## How does it work?
1. On left you can see text area to input your text. At this time you can input only latin letters.
2. Then you have to choose how many letters script should skip during ciphering.

   See how Caesar cipher works: [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher "Wikipedia").
   
 3. At last click "Cipher" and viola! Encrypted text shows on bottom of the page.
